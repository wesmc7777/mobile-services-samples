# [GettingStarted](./android)

This is the latest version of the **Get started with Mobile Services** quickstart app, using the Mobile Services SDK 2.0. Currently the sample available is for the Android platform and uses the Eclipse IDE.

This app is the one that can be downloaded from the Mobile Services portal quickstart page. The only difference is that the downloaded version has the mobile service url and credentials filled in, whereas this version contains placeholders.

For more information, see the [Get started with Mobile Services](http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/mobile-services-android-get-started/) tutorial.
